# Python Programming Assignments

![](machinelearning.jpg)

This repository contains solutions to the python versions of the programming assignments for the [Machine Learning online class](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) taught by Professor Andrew Ng.

The python versions of the assignments were taken from [@dibgerge](https://github.com/dibgerge)

- The assignments use [Jupyter Notebook](http://jupyter-notebook-beginner-guide.readthedocs.io/en/latest/what_is_jupyter.html), which provides an intuitive flow easier than the original MATLAB/OCTAVE assignments.
- The original assignment instructions have been completely re-written and the parts which used to reference MATLAB/OCTAVE functionality have been changed to reference its `python` counterpart.
- The re-written instructions are now embedded within the Jupyter Notebook along with the `python` starter code. For each assignment, all work is done solely within the notebook.
- The `python` assignments can be submitted for grading. They were tested to work perfectly well with the original Coursera grader that is currently used to grade the MATLAB/OCTAVE versions of the assignments. 
- After each part of a given assignment, the Jupyter Notebook contains a cell which prompts the user for submitting the current part of the assignment for grading.  

## Requirements 

These assignments has been tested and developed using the following libraries: 

    - python==3.6.4
    - numpy==1.13.3
    - scipy==1.0.0
    - matplotlib==2.1.2
    - jupyter==1.0.0
    - jupyter-client==5.0.1
    
## Python Tutorials

If you are new to python and to `jupyter` notebooks, no worries! There is a plethora of tutorials and documentation to get you started. Here are a few links which might be of help:

- [Python Programming](https://pythonprogramming.net/introduction-to-python-programming/): A turorial with videos about the basics of python. 

- [Numpy and matplotlib tutorial](http://cs231n.github.io/python-numpy-tutorial/): We will be using numpy extensively for matrix and vector operations. This is great tutorial to get you started with using numpy and matplotlib for plotting.

- [Jupyter notebook](https://medium.com/codingthesmartway-com-blog/getting-started-with-jupyter-notebook-for-python-4e7082bd5d46): Getting started with the jupyter notebook. 

- [Python introduction based on the class's MATLAB tutorial](https://github.com/mstampfer/Coursera-Stanford-ML-Python/blob/master/Coursera%20Stanford%20ML%20Python%20wiki.ipynb): This is the equivalent of class's MATLAB tutorial, in python.
